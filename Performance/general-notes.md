## The Three Places for Improvement

*  There are three places where work needs to happen when displaying Web sites
    - Client side or frontend
    - Network Latency
    - Backend Processing

## Client Side

* The front end device needs time to render the page on the screen.

## Network Latency

* An average web site makes more than 100 requests to load completely

## Backend Processing

*  improve the processing done on the backend or back in processing the web server needs time to load data maybe from the database and maybe even assemble the website before it sends it over

## Think like a senior developer

* There are infinite ways to improve your site
* you always focus on a problem and find a solution that solves that problem in the most efficient and valuable way
    - If you're optimizing your site but you don't even know what is slowing it down are you going to have comparison numbers or benchmarks to see if your optimizations have actually improved your speed.
        * Its going to end up wasting your time.
