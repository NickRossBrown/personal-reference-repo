## the easiest thing to improve on your website

* images are a little bit more complex, but often the easiest thing to improve on your website and
    - also the most commonly misused to slow down your upset

## Minimizing Images

* the primary way to change an image size is to change the file format and pick the file format that is the best for the job.
    - This is actually fairly easy to do was just a few clicks

## Use What for what
* transparency? use PNG
* animations? use GIF
* colorful images? use a JPG
* simple icons, logos, and illustrations? use SVGs

## JPG

* for complex images with lots of colors
* Tend to be a little bit big in file size
* usually used for photos images and things with many colors such as photographs
* don't really allow for transparency.


## PNG 

* Usually limit the number of colors you can use and they tend to be
* a lot smaller in size than jpegs because of that 
* used a lot around the web for things like logos since they usually only have a few sets of colors that you need
* The cool thing with piano is that you can add transparency to them 
    - which you cannot do in JPEG

## GIF

* Often look grainy and oddly colored
* Usually somewhere between 2 to 256 
    - reducing the color count leads to huge file savings

## SVG

* Vector Graphics 
* designers usually work with on Adobe, Illustrator, or sketch
* can expand an SVG several times its original size and be just as sharp + clear the original
    -  incredibly small for what they do and 
* they're really really good for things like retina display or 4K displays 
* you can also customize them using SS but they aren't
* usually tend to be very simplistic visual things with few callers

## reduce-PNG-JPG

* tinyPNG
* jpeg-optimizer

## rules of thumb

* Always compress the images
* Always lower JPEG image quality 30-60%
* Resize image based on size it will be displayed
* Use different sized images for different screen sizes
* Use cdns like imgIX 
* Remove metatags from photos
