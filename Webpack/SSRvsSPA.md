# Server Side verse Single Page Application

### Server side Templating 
* Back end server creates an html document and send it down to user. 
* Full rendered HTML document (everything a user wants to see)
* We rely on the server to put together the document

### Single Page App
* Server sends down a bare-bones (or a skeleton) HTML doc to the user. Javascript runs on the users machine to assemble a full webpage. 
* Once the HTML doc loads up. It grabs a few javascript scripts and that javascript is responsible for assembling page for user. 
* We rely for a big ol big of js code that is being executed on a user's machine
